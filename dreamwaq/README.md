**Author:** [Jungyeon Lee (curieuxjy)](https://github.com/curieuxjy)

I independently implemented the DreamWaQ algorithm based on the paper. The core component, **Context-aided Estimator Network (CENet)**, has been carefully implemented and verified to work as described. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it!

### Start **w/** docker

> Please follow the steps below when starting via docker based on this repository.
> A driver supporting CUDA 12.1 or higher must be installed.

1. Download [Isaac Gym - Ubuntu Linux 18.04 / 20.04 Preview 4](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym)
You may also need to install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
> NVIDIA Container Toolkit DOES NOT work with Docker Desktop., only work with [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)... Then you may need add user to docker to solve permission issue without root. see [Linux post-installation steps for Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
2. Move the downloaded `IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package.tar.gz` file to `asset/IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package.tar.gz`
3. Build docker with the following command:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/datafiles/Work-syncfree/go2_dreamwaq/dreamwaq
   docker build . -t dreamwaq/dreamwaq -f docker/Dockerfile  --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g)
   ```
> The original docker file use [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeiKeiLim/my_term/main/run.sh) which has a bug on neovim install. I fixed it using dreamwaq/docker/run_fixed.sh.
4. Run docker with the following command:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/datafiles/Work-syncfree/go2_dreamwaq/
   docker run -ti --privileged -e DISPLAY=:0 -e TERM=xterm-256color -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro --network host -v $PWD/dreamwaq:/home/user/dreamwaq --gpus all dreamwaq/dreamwaq /usr/bin/zsh
   ```
> Docker env has another issue, PyTorch requires GCC 9+, but the system default gcc command points to GCC 8.4.0. Here is the solution:
```bash 
#1. Update alternatives configuration
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-9 90
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 80
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-9 90
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 80

#2. Choose GCC 9 as default
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
sudo update-alternatives --config g++

#3. verify
gcc --version
#It should show gcc version 9.x.x

#4. clear pytorch cache
rm -rf /home/user/.cache/torch_extensions/py38_cu121
rm -rf /home/user/.cache/torch_extensions/*
```

### Command
Execute within the container:
```bash                                                                                                
cd dreamwaq/legged_gym/legged_gym/scripts                                                                                      
python3 train.py --task=a1_waq --headless 
#Don't use visual in docker version... potential memcpy error.
```
#### Training

```bash
python train.py --task=[TASK_NAME] --headless
```

- `--headless`: Option to run training without opening simulator window. Add this option when running on a server without display.

#### Inferencing

```bash
python play.py --task=[TASK_NAME] --load_run=[LOAD_FOLDER] --checkpoint=[CHECKPOINT_NUMBER]
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `[LOAD_FOLDER]` | Folder name inside `legged_gym/logs/[task folder]` | `Sep04_14-24-54_waq` |
| `[task folder]` | Task-specific log folder | `rough_a1/rough_a1_waq/rough_a1_est` |
| `[CHECKPOINT_NUMBER]` | Number of **model_[NUMBER].pt** file | `250` |

**Complete command example:**
```bash
python play.py --task=a1_waq --load_run=Sep04_14-24-54_waq --checkpoint=250
```

- Inferencing code to view a single agent up close: `mini_test.py` (options same as `play.py`)
- There are adjustable options in the main loop of each inferencing script, adjust True/False as needed.

#### Cross-computer Inference

If you want to inference a **model_[NUMBER].pt** file trained on a different computer:

| Step | Computer A (Training) | Computer B (Inferencing) |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | - | Create a new folder named `FOLDER_NAME` in `legged_gym/logs/[task folder]` |
| 2 | Copy **model_[NUMBER].pt** | Paste to `FOLDER_NAME` |
| 3 | - | Run `python play.py --task=[TASK_NAME] --load_run=[FOLDER_NAME] --checkpoint=[NUMBER]` |

![](./asset/two_models_rew.png)

### DreamWaQ model

- State plot of 1 robot agent after training
  - Row 1: Plot of x, y direction velocity and yaw direction command vs actual measured physical quantities from base state
  - Row 2: Plot of estimated velocity through CENet vs true velocity measured from simulator
  - Row 3: Error plot between estimated velocity and true velocity
    - Column 1: Squared error of each x, y, z direction component
    - Column 2, 3: Mean squared error of x, y directions

![](./asset/a1_waq_est_vel.png)

### Base model

- State plot of 1 robot agent after training (Unlike DreamWaQ, there is no estimated velocity, so the plotted graphs are different.)

  - Row 2 Column 1/2: Position and velocity of 1 joint
  - Row 2 Column 3: Base z direction velocity
